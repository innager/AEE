# EdgeworthExpansions
General order Edgeworth expansions

Generate Edgeworth expansions for one- and two-sample generalized-form *t*-statistics (including ordinary and moderated *t*-statistics and Welch's *t*-test); plus expansions for a general test statistic when the moments of this statistic's distribution are available. 

* Quick demonstration in Jupyter notebook for 3rd order expansions (EdgeTstat1smp.ipynb); 
* main documents are written in Sage notebook (.sws files), results up to 5th order;
* the copy of EdgeTstat1smp.sws is included as a text file (EdgeTstat1smpCopy.txt - can be used in Sage as well).
