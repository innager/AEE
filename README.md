# EdgeworthExpansions
General order Edgeworth expansions

Generate Edgeworth expansions for mean-based statistics; plus expansions for a general test statistic when the moments of this statistic's distribution are available. 

* Quick demonstration in Jupyter notebook for 3rd order expansions (EdgeTstat1smp.ipynb); 
* Main documents written in Sage notebook (.sws files) and the copy of one of the files as a text file (EdgeTstat1smpCopy.txt - can be used in Sage as well).
